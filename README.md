# Malware-Analysis - A beginner's guide

Recent studies have extensively explored malware analysis, focusing on static approaches employing machine learning, data mining, and deep learning. Techniques such as system call sequences and LSTM have been applied to analyze Android malware dynamically. Many researchers utilize n-grams or API calls to represent malware cases for data mining, emphasizing static analysis. Notably, B Jaya Prasad conducted static scanning without sandboxing or code de-obfuscation, analyzing a malware sample's RAM memory dump using Volatility and VirusTotal. Another study by Satya Narayan Tripathy explored information sharing on social platforms to detect malicious activities. Traditional static analysis involves running multiple tools and categorizing samples based on gathered information. Maryann Gorg introduced a methodology using machine learning for static analysis, aiming to develop a classifier capable of identifying malware in Windows Portable executable files.

Hardware Requirements:
  1. PC / Laptop
  2. At least 4 GB RAM
  3. Quad Core CPU

Software Requirements:
  1. Virtual Machine (Sandbox) - Ubuntu (16.04)
  2. Sandbox for analysis
  3. Malware Sample
  4. Host OS Version â€“ Windows 7

Malware analysis is the process of breaking down malware to understand its fundamental parts and source code and examining its traits, functionality, source, and effects to lessen the threat and stop such incidents in the future.

Malware Analysis can be categorized into four four major arears: (In this project, we will be covering only three.)

  1. Static Analysis: Static analysis is the technique of looking at questionable software or files without running them. Some of the detection patterns used in he static analysis include string signatures, byte-sequence n-grams, syntactic library calls, control flow graphs, and opcode (operational code) frequency distribution.
Tools Used: Hex Editor, md5sum, sha256sum, Virus Total, FLOSS, Exeinfo PE, CFF Explorer, YARA Rules

  2. Dynamic Analysis: Dynamic analysis of malware involves observing the behavior of malicious code as it executes in a controlled environment, such as a sandbox or virtual machine. This type of analysis helps security researchers and analysts understand how malware behaves, its impact on a system, and the techniques it uses to achieve its objectives. 
Tools Used: Process Hacker, Process Monitor, Wireshark, INetSIM

  3. Code Analysis (not included in project) : Analyzing malware involves examining its code to understand its functionality, behavior, and potential impact on a system. This process requires a careful and systematic approach to extract relevant information.
 
  4. In-memory Analysis /  Malware Forensics: Memory forensics is the study of volatile information obtained in a computer's memory dump, also known as memory analysis. Memory forensics is a method used by information security professionals to investigate and target attacks or malicious operations that leave no evident data-related traces on hard drives.
Tools Used: FTK Imager, Linux Commands
